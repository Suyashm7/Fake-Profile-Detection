## Fake Profile Detection using ML

The rise of social media has brought about a surge in fake profiles, posing significant risks to users, organizations, and the integrity of online platforms. This project proposes an innovative approach utilizing machine learning techniques for 
the detection and reporting of fake social media profiles. The objective is to empower users and platform administrators with a robust tool that can autonomously identify deceptive accounts. 

The methodology involves the collection of a diverse dataset encompassing genuine and fraudulent profiles across various social media platforms. Features such as profile picture analysis, user activity patterns, profile information 
consistency, and network analysis are extracted to develop a comprehensive understanding of legitimate and deceptive behaviors. 

A range of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, are explored and evaluated for their efficacy in binary classification. The selected model is 
trained on labeled data, and its performance is assessed through rigorous testing. The integration of the model with social media platforms allows for real-time analysis, enabling users to verify account authenticity and report suspicious profiles. 

Privacy considerations are paramount, and the proposed system adheres to relevant regulations to safeguard user information. Continuous monitoring and updates ensure adaptability to emerging tactics employed by malicious actors. 
This project contributes to the ongoing efforts to mitigate the proliferation of fake profiles on social media, fostering a safer and more trustworthy online environment. The presented model provides a practical solution for early 
detection, aiding both users and platform administrators in proactively addressing all the challenges which are associated with the deceptive online identities.
